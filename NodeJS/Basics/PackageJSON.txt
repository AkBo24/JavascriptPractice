projects.

To install a package: npm install *pkg name*
   Global installation - npm install -g *pkg name*

   Global unninstallation - npm uninstall -g *pkg name*

Npm can track what external packages a program requires with a Package.json
file

  to construct: npm init
  to save a dependency: npm install --save *pkg name*

To install the pkgs required by the program: npm install

To delete dependencies delete it from the Package.json or
    npm uninstall --save *pkg name*

The --save flag tells npm to update the Package.json file
