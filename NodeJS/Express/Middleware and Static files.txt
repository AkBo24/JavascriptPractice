GOTO: PartialEngines.js for an example of static css file

Middleware: the code that a server runs between recieving a request and
            sending a result

When you evoke the get() method provided by express the callback function param
is an example of Middleware (it runs normal JS code and can output back to the
user)

Static files: code that runs the same on every webpage (ex: all the engines use
the css inside /css/master.css)

We can access static code as such: app.use(*routing directory*, callback function);

  Param 1) Everytime this route is called the callback function is called
  Param 2) the callback function is structured as such:

           use(*routing directory*, (req, res, next) => {
              //some code
              next();
           });
           Req and Res function as normally

           next, when called, evokes the next middleware in line (for instance
           if there is another get method with a more specific routing code)

Express provides public, static methods that allow the callback function to
access files.
  express.static(*directory*);
      In PartialEngines.js the file is the css, the engines request master.css
      and receives it through the use middleware
