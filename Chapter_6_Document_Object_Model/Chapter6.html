    <h1 id = "title">Chapter 6: Document Object Model (DOM)</h1>
    

    <h2>What is the DOM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>an <b>api</b> created by the browser that parsing through HTML code and has available events for JavaScript</li>
        <li>Code found in DevTools (f12) is a visual representation of the DOM</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Everything created in HTML becomes a "node" in the DOM</li>
            <li><b>HTML is considered the root node</b> from which everything branches (think a tree data structure)</li>
            <li>Children of the root is the head and body</li>
            <ul>
                <li>inside the head and body are texts like p tags & headers, called <b>Text Node(s)</b></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>fixes some mistakes (syntactical errors etc) found in html</li>
        </ul>

        <li>More importantly:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><B>JavaScript manipulates the DOM</B></li>
            <li>can insert JavaScript code into the HTML</li>
            <li>Provides an API for JavaScript to use and create interactable websites (ex: the mouseenter function)</li>
        </ul>

    <p id = "update">Quering the DOM:</p>
    <p>A paragraph to query the DOM (using JavaScript), use document's .querySelector() method</p>
    <p class="query">Query for this paragraph using a class</p>

    </ul>

    <div class = "query">
        <p>This paragraph is inside a div to be queryed</p>
        <p>
            Since the div has a class, we use the div.classname (in this case query)
            to specify that we want to access the div and not the other element with this
            class name
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Getting and Setting HTML attributes</h2>
    <p>The link below has a href attribute and this paragraph has a class attribute</p>
    <p>In html the reference points to google but in JavaScript it was changed to amazon</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

    <h2>Adding and Removing Classes</h2>
    <p class = "error">This paragraph had the .error class in
         HTML but was changed to have the .success class through JavaScript</p>

    <h2>Accessing Children and Parents of the DOM</h2>
    <article>
        <p>These paragraphs are all inside an article tag</p>
        <p>None of them have a class provided through HTML, but using the child</p>
        <p>property available in the DOM, I can add classes through JavaScript,</p>
        <p>without having to access each of the individual paragraphs, the color is changed to darkcyan</p>
    </article>

    <h2>Event Listener: Click</h2>

    <ul class = 'eventListener'>
        <li class = 'strike'>These paragraphs are in a list</li>
        <li class = 'strike'>When you click on them they strike through</li>
        <li class = 'strike'>This is done using the event listener in JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
